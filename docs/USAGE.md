# Configuration

There's a couple of command line flags you can use with `blitzloop` - run
`blitzloop --help` to see them. All of them can be overriden via one of two
config files:

 * `/etc/blitzloop/cfg`
 * `~/.blitzloop/cfg`

See [this file][example.cfg] for an example. You don't **need** a config file,
if you're happy with defaults.
